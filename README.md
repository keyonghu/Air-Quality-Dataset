# Data Set
## **1.Data set description**
The data set is composed of two parts, namely temporal feature data and spatial feature data.
## **2.Data set download**
Since there are three relatively large files in the Temporal_Airquality file (airquality.csv, meteorology.csv and weatherforecast.csv), the git-lfs tool was used to upload successfully. 
But when we go to package and download, these three files will have some problems. 
 There are two solutions:
