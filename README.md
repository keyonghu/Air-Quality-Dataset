# Data Set
## **1.Data set description**
The data set is composed of two parts, which are placed in Temporal_Airquality(including air quliaty data) and Spatial catalog, respectively.
## **2.Data set download**
We use the git-lfs tool to upload the large files in the Temporal_Airquality (airquality.csv, meteorology.csv and weatherforecast.csv).So when we  download the three files from github web pages, these three files can not directly downloaded.
